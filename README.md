# **Front-end development from scratch**

## This repository is used to keep all my code and exercises which I have done along a Polish front-end development course: "Od podstaw do front-end developera" ("Front-end development from scratch"). The author of this course is an experienced Polish front-end developer - Bart≈Çomiej Borowczyk, known also as Samuraj Programowania.
This course is available on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/kurs-web-developer-od-podstaw-w-15-dni/).

The author also created a [website dedicated to this course](https://websamuraj.pl).

Some parts of the code are copied and rewritten by me in Brackets and some parts are my own solutions to the given problems.


### **This course consists of six parts:**

1. Web-developer from scratch in 15 days.

2. Advanced front-end development.

3. JavaScript programming.

4. React from basics - theory and practice.

5. Backend - Node.js, Express, MongoDB.

6. Advanced projects in CSS and JavaScript.
